# Escape-Room-Software-Design-Patterns

Welcome to the Escape Room! This is a challenging and immersive game where you will need to use your problem-solving skills, and creativity to escape from a series of rooms.

To start, you will select a theme for your game. Each theme has its own unique set of rooms and challenges. Once you have selected a theme, you will be transported into a room that is themed accordingly.

The goal of the game is to escape from the room within a time limit. To do this, you will need to find clues and solve puzzles. 

There are three rooms in total. Each room is more challenging than the last. If you are able to escape from all three rooms within the time limit, you will win the game! test
